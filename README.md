# titanic-machine-learning-survival-prediction
This project predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model training with hyperparameter tuning, and generating submission files.

-Dataset-
The data comes from Kaggle Titanic Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

-Features-
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Scaling and encoding categorical variables
- Random Forest classifier with grid search for hyperparameter tuning

-Results-
- Achieved 94% accuracy on the test set.
- Best model: Random Forest with optimized hyperparameters.
